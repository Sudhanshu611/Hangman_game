"""
This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language. Beginners can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic.

1. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it.
2. **The Game:** Here, a random word (a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
3. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
4. For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five-letter word.

        # In Python, KeyboardInterrupt is a built-in exception that occurs when the user interrupts the execution of a program using a keyboard action, typically by pressing Ctrl+C. Handling KeyboardInterrupt is crucial, especially in scenarios where a program involves time-consuming operations or user interactions. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to catch KeyboardInterrupt in Python.
